This is a simple pomodoro timer I made so I can focus on my work without getting distracted. Here are some features:

- Movable player used to interact with surroundings and move around (A-left, D - right, space - jump, left click- attack)
- Interactive objects: A start/stop timer and two more which allows you to increase or decrase the length of cycles (All toggled through the player attacks)
- Timer will continuously loop itself unless the timer is stopped
